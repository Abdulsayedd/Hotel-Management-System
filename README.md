# Hotel Management Application - ADO.NET to Entity Framework Conversion


## Description

This project aims to convert the existing Hotel Management application from ADO.NET to Entity Framework, Features and details included in NazimAmin Repo.


### Conversion Process

The ADO.NET to Entity Framework conversion process involves the following steps:

1. **Database Schema Analysis:** Analyze the existing ADO.NET database schema of the original project [https://github.com/nazimamin/HotelManagement](https://github.com/nazimamin/HotelManagement) to identify the tables, relationships, and constraints.

2. **Entity Framework Configuration:** Set up the Entity Framework in the project by installing the required NuGet packages and configuring the database context.

3. **Data Model Creation:** Create the necessary data models (entities) to represent the tables in the database. Define the relationships between entities using Fluent API or Data Annotations.

4. **Repository Pattern:** Implement the repository pattern to abstract the data access layer and centralize database operations.

5. **Migrations:** Generate and apply migrations to bring the Entity Framework database schema in sync with the existing ADO.NET schema.

6. **Data Access Code Refactoring:** Replace the existing ADO.NET data access code in the original project [https://github.com/nazimamin/HotelManagement](https://github.com/nazimamin/HotelManagement) with Entity Framework's methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

7. **Unit Testing:** Conduct unit tests to ensure that the data access layer is functioning correctly with Entity Framework.
